This project introduces basic Python concepts with a focus on lists, loops, and functions.
There are small functions that perform specific operations on lists such as printing values, accessing elements, modifying values, and more.

This project is designed for beginners and follows simple Python rules:

No importing modules unless specified

Clean code

Using only allowed syntax (e.g., using str.format() instead of converting to string)
