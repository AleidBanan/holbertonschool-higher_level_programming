TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Test for extra argument:
>>> matrix = [[2, 3], [5, 7]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 4, 4)
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: matrix_divided() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given

Test for too few argument:
>>> matrix = [[2, 3], [5, 7]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix)
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: matrix_divided() missing 1 required positional argument: 'div'

Test div as 0 and non int and float:
>>> matrix = [[2, 3], [5, 7]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)

Test for different size of list:
>>> matrix = [[2, 3], [5, 7, 8]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 4)
