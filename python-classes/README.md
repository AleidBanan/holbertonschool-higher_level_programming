This repository contains a series of Python tasks that explore the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) specifically how to define classes and manipulate their attributes and behaviors.
Each task builds upon the previous one to progressively create a fully functional Square class.

File	Description
0-square.py	Defines an empty class Square that represents a square.
1-square.py	Defines a class Square with a private instance attribute size.
2-square.py	Adds validation for the size attribute (must be an integer i¥ 0).
3-square.py	Introduces a public method area() that returns the area of the square.
4-square.py	Adds getter and setter methods to access and update size safely.
5-square.py	Adds the ability to print a square with the # character using the my_print() method.
6-square.py	Introduces coordinates (position) to adjust where the square is printed on the screen.
